"""
This function is used to identify the number of leading basic modes according to the elbow point of Sigma curve
Syntax: 
    leading_number = get_leading_number(sigma)
Inputï¼š
    sigma: An N_basic * 1 vector, containing weights of basic modes, sorted in the descending order
Output:
    leading_number: a scalar denoting number of leading basic modes.
